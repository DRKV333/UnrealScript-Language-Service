## Features

This is a work-in-progress extension for Visual Studio Code, its goal is to bring a rich editing experience to UnrealScript, the Unreal Engine's domain specific language.

So far the extension has implemented support for the following features:

* Semantic Syntax Highlighting
* Diagnostics (linting)
* Symbol Searching
* Symbol Renaming
* Find All References
* Go to Definition, Peek Definition
* Quick Info (hover tooltips)
* Auto-Completion
* Code-Actions (create new class)

Beware, for *Symbol Renaming* and *Find All References* it is recommended to enable *Index All Documents*
